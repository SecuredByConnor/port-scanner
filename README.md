## 🧠 Motivation
This tool forms part of my cybersecurity learning journey.  
As a junior penetration tester, I am building small, ethical tools to showcase practical abilities in:

- Python scripting  
- Network fundamentals  
- Reconnaissance methodology  
- Secure and responsible tooling  
- Version control & branching with Git
